When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When colaborating with others, also may be useful when you are on the go and need access from multiple sources.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not have production ready code on your local computer and you would not want github to automatically 
    select when to sync your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is simply a copy, and can be used whenever, but it doesn't give proper credit to original author on github. A branch is simply when you are taking the code a different direction, often used in implementing new features or collaboration. Finally, a fork is similiar to a clone, where you have copied the entire repository and made it stand on its own, but it does show others where the original code came from, also on github it allows the coder to more easily suggest changes to the originator.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
