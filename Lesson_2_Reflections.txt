What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository you are essentially preparing git to track changes by utilizing commits, otherwise you will not be
able to use git to track changes. In hindsight I probably would do seperate commits, since the files are unrelated to one another.

The working directory is simply the folder in which you git information is contained, however you are not required to have everything with in your working directory added to your staging area and subsequently your commits.

Using commits for a single logic change seems both valuable and simple. Using git diff (with no arguments), and git diff --staged I can see the difference between all three of my spaces, meaning I can see the difference between my most recent commit and staging area with git diff 	--staged. And I can see the difference between my staging area and working directory with git diff. Finally, I can use git status to see what files have been added to the staging area. With this knowledge I can easily change multiple files but commit them seperately.

Branches can help keep things organinzing by allowing a user to make drastically different changes to code, and follow those paths where ever they may lead. But the coder will still be able to navigating back down and take another branch if need be.

Branch diagrams help you see all the different directions a program has taken, and from what point each branch "branched" out from

The ability to merge branches is really what makes collaboration possible. Without the 'merge' command, combining files would be tedious.

Git's automatic merge makes collaboration much simpler. It is especialy useful in finding discrepencies and bringing them to the coders attention. The downside is that it is not perfect, conflicts still need to be be resolved manually, but at least they are brought to the coders attention.
